- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


Encapsulation makes things fit together nicely and reduces redundant code but requires more planning and forethought. Overall this wasn't too hard, but I did have to slow down and make sure I had everything interacting the way it was supposed to. I'm a visual thinker so I'd recommend drawing a flow chart of the necessary interactions between the classes to keep track of which classes need to call which methods from other classes.
